At the Cognition, Health, and Technology Lab (CHTLab) we use technology to understand neuropsychological functioning in healthy persons and persons experiencing mental and physical illnesses.

Our team implements quantitative and qualitative approaches to research these topics and develop robust knowledge. We combine innovative and traditional data collection methods such as:
- mobile devices (e.g., smartphone, tablet)
- web-based cognitive tasks
- lab-based computerized cognitive tasks
- standardized neuropsychological and achievement tests
- surveys
- interviews and focus groups

If you are interested in learning more about our work or collaborating with the CHTLab team, please contact us at cltlab@psm.edu.
